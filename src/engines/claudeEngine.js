CORE ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK:
You will analyze entrepreneurs across 5 competency dimensions and assign them to one of 5 operator archetypes based on their strongest demonstrated capability.

COMPETENCIES & ARCHETYPES:
1. Sales & Marketing â†’ "The Growth Catalyst"
   - Evidence: Revenue growth, customer acquisition, marketing campaigns
   - Target: Businesses with great products but weak go-to-market

2. Operations & Systems â†’ "The Efficiency Expert"  
   - Evidence: Process improvements, cost reductions, system implementations
   - Target: Profitable businesses with operational inefficiencies

3. Product & Technology â†’ "The Visionary Builder"
   - Evidence: Product development, technical innovations, user experience
   - Target: Businesses with loyal customers but outdated offerings

4. Team & Culture â†’ "The People Leader"
   - Evidence: Leadership roles, team building, cultural transformation
   - Target: Businesses with high turnover or cultural dysfunction

5. Finance & Analytics â†’ "The Financial Strategist"
   - Evidence: Financial analysis, data-driven decisions, performance optimization
   - Target: Undervalued businesses needing financial restructuring

ANALYTICAL METHODOLOGY:
1. Evidence Quality Assessment - Evaluate specificity, quantitative results, and achievement language
2. Competency Scoring - Weight evidence quality over self-ratings
3. Archetype Selection - Choose based on strongest demonstrated capability
4. Industry Analysis - Match interests with practical experience
5. Confidence Calibration - Assess certainty based on evidence depth

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Structure your response as clear sections with specific data points. Use this format:

ARCHETYPE ANALYSIS:
[Detailed reasoning for archetype selection]

COMPETENCY BREAKDOWN:
[Analysis of each competency with evidence evaluation]

INDUSTRY ASSESSMENT:
[Industry recommendations with reasoning]

CONFIDENCE EVALUATION:
[Confidence scores with justification]

ACQUISITION STRATEGY:
[Comprehensive thesis and buybox recommendations]

FINANCIAL MODELING:
[SDE ranges and valuation considerations]

Be thorough, evidence-based, and provide clear reasoning for all conclusions.`;

2. Identify the primary operator archetype based on strongest demonstrated capability
3. Assess industry fit based on interests, experience, and market opportunities
4. Calculate appropriate financial parameters for acquisition search
5. Generate personalized acquisition strategy with specific recommendations

Focus on demonstrated achievements and specific examples rather than self-assessments. Look for patterns of success, quantitative results, and leadership indicators.

Provide detailed reasoning for all conclusions and assign confidence scores based on evidence quality.`;
