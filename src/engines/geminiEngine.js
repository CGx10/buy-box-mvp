- Shared acquisition thesis elements
- Aligned buybox criteria
- Consistent leverage points

### 2.3. DIVERGENCE ANALYSIS
Highlight nuanced differences:
- Different archetype perspectives
- Varying strategic approaches
- Complementary insights
- Framework-specific recommendations

### 2.4. INTEGRATED SYNTHESIS
Synthesize all frameworks into a comprehensive analysis that:
- Acknowledges multiple perspectives
- Provides a balanced strategic approach
- Highlights both consensus and divergence
- Enables deeper strategic thinking

## OUTPUT FORMAT
Your final output MUST be a single Markdown-formatted report containing the following sections, in this exact order:

**Part 1: Multi-Framework Analysis Overview**
A comprehensive summary that synthesizes and compares the findings from the four separate analyses below. This overview explains WHY the different methodologies produce different results and highlights areas of consensus and divergence to provide strategic perspective.

Template: "Our comprehensive analysis, viewing your profile through four distinct strategic lenses, reveals several key insights. While each framework offers a unique perspective, a clear consensus emerges around your core strengths in {common themes, e.g., revenue generation and operational leadership}.

**Archetype Analysis:** Two primary archetypes were identified, showcasing your dual potential. The divergence reflects each methodology's analytical focus:

* **The Growth Catalyst:** Identified by the Hedgehog and EO frameworks, this archetype emphasizes your passion-driven, growth-oriented approach. These frameworks prioritize your innovative thinking and risk tolerance, naturally leading to higher-growth, lower-SDE targets ($100k-$500k) with significant upside potential.

* **The Efficiency Expert:** Identified by the Traditional M&A and SWOT frameworks, this archetype focuses on your proven operational and systems expertise. These frameworks prioritize your track record of improving existing businesses, leading to larger, more established targets ($250k-$1M SDE) where operational improvements can unlock immediate value.

**Financial Analysis:** The different SDE ranges reflect each strategy's risk-return profile. Growth Catalyst targets offer lower initial investment but require higher risk tolerance and growth execution. Efficiency Expert targets offer more predictable returns through operational improvements but require larger capital deployment.

**Strategic Implications:** This duality does not represent a contradiction, but a significant strategic advantage. It means you are equally equipped to either scale a business with untapped market potential (Growth Catalyst) or to acquire a business with solid revenue but inefficient operations and unlock hidden value (Efficiency Expert). The following detailed reports will explore both of these compelling strategic paths."

**Part 2: Detailed Framework Reports**
Present the complete, separate analysis for each of the four frameworks. Each analysis must be presented in its own clean, "white-box" style with professional formatting.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION:** For each report, you must conduct the analysis as if it were the ONLY framework being used. The financial parameters, industries, and other criteria must be derived solely from the logic of that specific framework, ensuring four distinct and specific recommendations. Do not blend insights across frameworks - each analysis must be independent and true to that methodology's unique perspective.

## Part 3: Final Strategic Considerations

A final summary that synthesizes the key leverage points and red flags identified across all four frameworks.

**Template:**
Synthesizing the analyses, two primary leverage points emerge: 1) your ability to drive revenue growth in businesses with underdeveloped marketing, and 2) your capacity to dramatically improve efficiency in operationally weak companies. Conversely, the key red flags to watch for are businesses with high customer concentration or outdated, inflexible technology, as these could neutralize your core strengths.

## AI TRANSPARENCY & METHODOLOGY
This analysis was conducted using a comprehensive multi-framework approach, applying Traditional M&A Analysis, The Hedgehog Concept, SWOT Analysis, and Entrepreneurial Orientation simultaneously. This methodology provides a 360-degree view of the entrepreneur's profile, highlighting both consensus insights and nuanced differences to enable deeper strategic thinking and more informed acquisition decisions.

**Multi-Framework Benefits:**
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Each framework provides a different analytical lens
- **Consensus Validation**: Where frameworks agree, confidence is higher
- **Nuanced Insights**: Where frameworks diverge, multiple strategic options emerge
- **Strategic Depth**: Forces deeper thinking about acquisition strategy
- **Risk Mitigation**: Multiple perspectives reduce blind spots

**Additional Analysis Details:**
- Explain how you determined the operator archetype (which competencies were weighted most heavily)
- Describe your approach to identifying target industries (how you matched interests with market opportunities)
- Detail your financial parameter calculations (how you arrived at the SDE range)
- Explain your geographic preference analysis (how you interpreted location data)

**Confidence Assessment:**
- Rate your confidence in the archetype determination (0-1 scale)
- Rate your confidence in the industry recommendations (0-1 scale)  
- Rate your confidence in the financial parameters (0-1 scale)
- Rate your overall confidence in the analysis (0-1 scale)

**Data Sources & Limitations:**
- Note which data points were most influential in your analysis
- Identify any missing information that would improve the analysis
- Explain any assumptions you made during the analysis
